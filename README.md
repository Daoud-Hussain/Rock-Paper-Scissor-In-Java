A great learning project to do. It'll really help you to clear the concepts of controlling loop with flag value, importing random module, sequence, comparing strings etc.  
<p> <b>Rules:</b> <br>
The familiar game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played like this: at the same time, two players display one of three symbols: a rock, paper, or scissors. A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by covering it. ... Whenever one player wins, the other loses. </p>
